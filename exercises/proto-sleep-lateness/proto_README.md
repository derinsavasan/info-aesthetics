I want to stop being chronically late to everything.
Dataset gathered during my senior year at Georgetown.
Prototype includes datapoints from October 2023 only.

Next steps:
    Datapoints for the entire academic year (I have)
    Hover feature for each data point that displays:
        Date
        Sleep
        Late
    Trends?
        Interesting that I'm not late when sleep < 3 hrs
        Outliers (birthdays? finals? midterms?)
