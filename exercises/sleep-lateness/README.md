# Senior Year at Georgetown: Hours Slept vs. Minutes Late to First Class

A visual diary of my senior-year mornings, courtesy of my Oura ring and bad decisions.
- One dot = one **weekday** from late August to early May (excludes major holidays and weekends)
- X = Hours of Sleep (night before)
- Y = Minutes Late to First Class
- Nap zone (<3h) shaded: a gamble that usually behaves like a "nap" (too short for deep sleep >> easier to snap out of >> allows me to be on time)

Tooltips show exact date and values
- Challange: Find my birthday
- Clue: it's an outlier
